It provides a decentralized and transparent way for businesses to manage referral programs, ensuring that referrers are fairly compensated for their efforts.

## Features

- **Register Referrer**:
  - Businesses can register referrers, starting with zero tokens.
- **Reward Referrer**:
  - Referrers can earn tokens when their referrals lead to successful outcomes, with tokens being transferred to their account.

## Future Scope

1. **Referral Tracking**:

   - Implement detailed tracking of referral links and successful conversions for better analytics.

2. **Referral Tiers**:

   - Introduce tiered rewards based on the number of successful referrals, encouraging more engagement.

3. **Automated Referrals**:
   - Add automation to reward referrers immediately upon a successful referral being confirmed.

The **ReferralProgram** contract provides an efficient and decentralized system for managing referral rewards, driving growth through incentivized referrals.
